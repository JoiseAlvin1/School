		  <p>On April 1 the React Club at West Brook Middle School donated an Easter meal to one of West Bergen Mental Healthcare’s group homes. West Bergen was founded in 1963 to serve the mental health needs of the residents of Bergen county. It services over 3,000 people each year through a wide variety of programs and services tailored to the special needs of children, families, adults, and seniors. 

One of the programs at West Bergen Healthcare provides group homes for those individuals who are unable to live independently and often do not have the support of family and friends. The group homes provide activities for the residents to help them become more proficient at life skills such as meal planning, cooking, and taking care of their health. 

The purpose of the React Club is to promote goodwill through local community service. It has been hard to do so because of COVID-19, but the student members of React have been creative in finding ways to overcome the challenges.

When the opportunity arose to help the Mahwah Group Home residents celebrate Easter, the React members were eager to help. The members provided food and decorations that helped the home provide a festive and bountiful Easter meal. We hope the group home had a great Easter celebration!</p>

		  <p>On March 3, 2021, students at both East Brook and West Brook middle schools had the opportunity to engage in a virtual assembly program facilitated by the district’s Care Plus clinicians.

Diane Wirth, LCSW, Lara Librie, LPC, Staci Chmielesk, LCSW, and Jackie Emerson, LSW delivered a live broadcast to both middle school students in 5th through 8th grades. The focus of this Care Plus presentation was to continue to focus on social-emotional learning. The clinicians from both schools focused on feelings, stress, and anxiety. Stress management strategies were presented to the students in a Jeopardy format. Students from both East Brook and West Brook engaged in a Jeopardy game that focused on healthy coping skills, mind and body, problem solving skills, and time management.

The initiative to support students was a goal established by the administration, counselors, teachers, and Care Plus.

		  <p>Bergen Brain Busters gives our middle school students the opportunity to compete in a challenging academic competition that allows them to use their academic ability and critical thinking skills to answer questions from all areas of the middle school curriculum. Two teams from each school compete in a series of playoff rounds. The teams with the highest scores from the playoffs will compete in the semi-final and final rounds. This club, like others, requires dedication and commitment through preparation and competition.

The club is open to any interested sixth, seventh, and eighth-grade students. Sixth-grade students benefit from the exposure of the trivia questions and procedures of the game. Only seventh and eighth-grade students are eligible to compete in the competitions. There are several try-outs throughout the year for club members to determine who will participate in the monthly meets. </p>
